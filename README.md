## Contrastive Multiview Coding

This repo covers the implementation for CMC (as well as Momentum Contrast and Instance Discrimination), which learns representations from multiview data in a self-supervised way (by multiview, we mean multiple sensory, multiple modal data, or literally multiple viewpoint data. It's flexible to define what is a "view"):

## Highlights

**(1) Representation quality as a function of number of contrasted views.** 

We found that, the more views we train with, the better the representation (of each single view).

**(2) Contrastive objective v.s. Predictive objective**

We compare the contrastive objective to cross-view prediction, finding an advantage to the contrastive approach.

**(3) Unsupervised v.s. Supervised**

Several ResNets trained with our **unsupervised** CMC objective surpasses **supervisedly** trained AlexNet on ImageNet classification ( e.g., 68.4% v.s. 59.3%). For this first time on ImageNet classification, unsupervised methods are surpassing the classic supervised-AlexNet proposed in 2012 (CPC++ and AMDIM also achieve this milestone concurrently). 

## Updates

Aug 20, 2019 - ResNets on ImageNet have been added.

Nov 26, 2019 - New results updated. Implementation of **MoCo** and **InsDis** added.

Jan 18, 2019 - Weights of **InsDis** and **MoCo** added.

## Installation

This repo was tested with Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS, Python 3.5, PyTorch 0.4.0, and CUDA 9.0. But it should be runnable with recent PyTorch versions >=0.4.0

**Note:** It seems to us that training with Pytorch version >= 1.0 yields slightly worse results. If you find the similar discrepancy and figure out the problem, please report this since we are trying to fix it as well.

## Training AlexNet/ResNets with CMC on ImageNet

**Note:** For AlexNet, we split across the channel dimension and use each half to encode L and ab. For ResNets, we use a standard ResNet model to encode each view.

NCE flags:
- `--nce_k`: number of negatives to contrast for each positive. Default: 4096
- `--nce_m`: the momentum for dynamically updating the memory. Default: 0.5
- `--nce_t`: temperature that modulates the distribution. Default: 0.07 for ImageNet, 0.1 for STL-10

Path flags:
- `--data_folder`: specify the ImageNet data folder.
- `--model_path`: specify the path to save model.
- `--tb_path`: specify where to save tensorboard monitoring events.

Model flag:
- `--model`: specify which model to use, including *alexnet*, *resnets18*, *resnets50*, and *resnets101*

IM flag:
- `--IM`: train with IM space.
- `--IM_type`: specify the type of IM and other augmentation methods that we implement, including: 'IM', 'global', 'region', 'Cutout', 'RandomErasing'.

Global mixture:
- `--g_alpha`: global mix alpha. Default: 1.0
- `--g_num`: global mix num. Default: 2
- `--g_prob`: global mix prob. Default: 0.1

Region-level mixture:
- `--r_beta`: region mix beta. Default: 1.0
- `--r_prob`: region mix prob. Default: 0.1
- `--r_num`: region mix num. Default: 2
- `--r_pixel_decay`: region mix pixel decay. Default: 1.0

An example of command line for training CMC (Default: `AlexNet` on Single GPU)
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_CMC.py --batch_size 256 --num_workers 36 \
 --data_folder /path/to/data 
 --model_path /path/to/save 
 --tb_path /path/to/tensorboard
```

Training CMC with ResNets requires at least 4 GPUs, the command of using `resnet50v1` looks like
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_CMC.py --model resnet50v1 --batch_size 128 --num_workers 24
 --data_folder path/to/data \
 --model_path path/to/save \
 --tb_path path/to/tensorboard \
```

To support mixed precision training, simply append the flag `--amp`, which, however is likely to harm the downstream classification. I measure it on ImageNet100 subset and the gap is about 0.5-1%.

By default, the training scripts will use L and ab as two views for contrasting. You can switch to `YCbCr` by specifying `--view YCbCr`, which yields better results (about 0.5-1%). If you want to use other color spaces as different views, follow the line [here](https://github.com/HobbitLong/CMC/blob/master/train_CMC.py#L146) and other color transfer functions are already available in `dataset.py`.

## Training Linear Classifier

Path flags:
- `--data_folder`: specify the ImageNet data folder. Should be the same as above.
- `--save_path`: specify the path to save the linear classifier.
- `--tb_path`: specify where to save tensorboard events monitoring linear classifier training.

Model flag `--model` is similar as above and should be specified.

Specify the checkpoint that you want to evaluate with `--model_path` flag, this path should directly point to the `.pth` file.

This repo provides 3 ways to train the linear classifier: *single GPU*, *data parallel*, and *distributed data parallel*.

An example of command line for evaluating, say `./models/alexnet.pth`, should look like:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python LinearProbing.py --dataset imagenet \
 --data_folder /path/to/data \
 --save_path /path/to/save \
 --tb_path /path/to/tensorboard \
 --model_path ./models/alexnet.pth \
 --model alexnet --learning_rate 0.1 --layer 5
```

**Note:** When training linear classifiers on top of ResNets, it's important to use large learning rate, e.g., 30~50. Specifically, change `--learning_rate 0.1 --layer 5` to `--learning_rate 30 --layer 6` for `resnet50v1` and `resnet50v2`, to `--learning_rate 50 --layer 6` for `resnet50v3`.

## Pretrained Models
Pretrained weights can be found in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5k4t77mt4011gyr/AABkBvKm2bGNNut0m6bLMK84a?dl=0).

Note: 
- CMC weights are trained with `NCE` loss, `Lab` color space, `4096` negatives and `amp` option. Switching to `softmax-ce` loss, `YCbCr`, `65536` negatives, and turning off `amp` option, are likely to improve the results.
- `CMC_resnet50v2.pth` and `CMC_resnet50v3.pth` are trained with FastAutoAugment, which improves the downstream accuracy by 0.8~1%. I will update weights without FastAutoAugment once they are available.

InsDis and MoCo are trained using the same hyperparameters as in MoCo (`epochs=200, lr=0.03, lr_decay_epochs=120,160, weight_decay=1e-4`), but with only 4 GPUs.

|          |Arch | #Params(M) | Loss  | #Negative  | Accuracy(%) | Delta(%) |
|----------|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  InsDis | ResNet50 | 24  | NCE  | 4096  |  56.5  |   - | 
|  InsDis | ResNet50 | 24  | Softmax-CE  | 4096  |  57.1  | +0.6 |

|  MoCo | ResNet50 | 24  | Softmax-CE  | 16384  |  59.4  | +0.9|


## Momentum Contrast and Instance Discrimination

I have implemented and tested MoCo and InsDis on a ImageNet100 subset (but the code allows one to train on full ImageNet simply by setting the flag `--dataset imagenet`):

The pre-training stage:

- For InsDis:
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_moco_ins.py \
     --batch_size 128 --num_workers 24 --nce_k 16384 --softmax
    ```
- For MoCo:
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_moco_ins.py \
     --batch_size 128 --num_workers 24 --nce_k 16384 --softmax --moco
    ```
  
The linear evaluation stage:
- For both InsDis and MoCo (lr=10 is better than 30 on this subset, for full imagenet please switch to 30):
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python eval_moco_ins.py --model resnet50 \
     --model_path /path/to/model --num_workers 24 --learning_rate 10
    ```
  
The comparison of `CMC` (using YCbCr), `MoCo` and `InsDIS` on my ImageNet100 subset, is tabulated as below:

|          |Arch | #Params(M) | Loss  | #Negative  | Accuracy |
|----------|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  InsDis | ResNet50 | 24  | NCE  | 16384  |  --  |
|  InsDis | ResNet50 | 24  | Softmax-CE  | 16384  |  69.1  |
|  MoCo | ResNet50 | 24  | NCE  | 16384  |  --  |
|  MoCo | ResNet50 | 24  | Softmax-CE  | 16384  |  73.4  |
|  CMC | 2xResNet50half | 12  | NCE  | 4096  |  --  |
|  CMC | 2xResNet50half | 12  | Softmax-CE  | 4096  |  75.8  |
